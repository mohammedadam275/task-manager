# 🗂️ TaskFlow – Task Management Web App

**Author:** Mohammed Adam

TaskFlow is a modern, responsive task management web application built with React. It allows users to create, update, delete, and organize tasks using filters, categories, and preset task bundles. The project focuses on clean UI, usability, and core CRUD functionality while demonstrating practical React concepts such as state management, controlled components, and component-based architecture.
